# Dynamic E-Commerce Storefront

A lightweight, high-performance e-commerce front-end built with vanilla web technologies. This project demonstrates how to manage a product catalog and shopping cart state without external frameworks.

## 🚀 Features
* **Dynamic Rendering**: Products are injected into the DOM from a JSON data source.
* **Shopping Cart**: Add/remove items and calculate totals in real-time.
* **Responsive Design**: Fully optimized for Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop views.
* **Persistent Cart**: Uses `localStorage` to remember user items after page reloads.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **HTML5**: Semantic structure.
* **CSS3**: Custom properties (variables) and CSS Grid.
* **JavaScript (ES6+)**: DOM manipulation and Fetch API.
